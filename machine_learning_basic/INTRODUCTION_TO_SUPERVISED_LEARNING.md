# Section 2.1: An Introduction to Supervised Learning

In the context of machine learning, supervised learning is a type of learning paradigm where a model is trained using a labeled dataset, consisting of input data along with their corresponding desired output or target values. The goal of supervised learning is to enable the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs, so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, and the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.

Here are some examples of supervised learning applications:

| Input (X)           | Output (Y)           | Application   |
| :---              |    :----:            |          ---: |
| Email content	| Spam or not spam	|Spam filtering |
| Customer demographic data, purchase history	| Will make a purchase in the next month or not	| Customer retention prediction |
| Patient health records	| Presence or absence of disease	| Medical diagnosis|
| House features (size, location, number of rooms, etc.)	| Price	| Real estate price prediction |
