# Image Flipping with OpenCV

## Introduction:

This code uses the OpenCV library in Python to flip an image in different directions, namely horizontal,
 vertical, or both. The code defines a function **flip_image** that takes an image and a direction as input
  and returns the flipped image. It then loads an image from a specified path, 
  performs the flipping operations using the flip_image function, and displays the original 
  and flipped images using OpenCV's **cv2.imshow()** function.

To execute the code, you need to have OpenCV installed. 
You can install it using the command **`pip install opencv-python`**. 
Additionally, you need to replace the **'HBD.jpg'** with the actual path to your image file.

## Code Overview:

The main goal of this code is to demonstrate how to flip an image in different directions using OpenCV. 
It provides a flexible function flip_image that allows you to specify 
the desired flipping direction: **horizontal, vertical, or both**. 
The code then applies this function to the loaded image and displays the original and flipped images.

## Code Breakdown:

Let's break down the code step by step:

```python

import cv2
```

Here, we import the **cv2** module, which provides the necessary functions for image manipulation using OpenCV.

```python

def flip_image(image, direction):
    if direction == 'horizontal':
        flipped_image = cv2.flip(image, 1)
    elif direction == 'vertical':
        flipped_image = cv2.flip(image, 0)
    elif direction == 'both':
        flipped_image = cv2.flip(image, -1)
    else:
        print("Invalid direction! Please choose 'horizontal', 'vertical', or 'both'.")
        return None
    return flipped_image
 ```
    
This code defines the **flip_image** function that takes an image and a direction as input parameters. 
The function uses a conditional statement (if-elif-else) to determine the flipping operation based on 
the direction specified. If the direction is **'horizontal'**, it uses **`cv2.flip(image, 1)`** to flip 
the image horizontally. If the direction is **'vertical'**, it uses **`cv2.flip(image, 0)`** to flip 
the image vertically. If the direction is **'both'**, it uses **`cv2.flip(image, -1)`** to flip 
the image in both directions. If an invalid direction is provided, 
it prints an error message and returns **`None`**. The function then returns the flipped image.

```python

image_path = 'HBD.jpg'  # Replace with your image path
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
```

These lines of code define the path to the image file you want to flip. 
Replace **'HBD.jpg'** with the actual path to your image file. 
The code then uses the **`cv2.imread()`** function to load the image into the image variable.

```python

horizontal_flip = flip_image(image, 'horizontal')
vertical_flip = flip_image(image, 'vertical')
both_flip = flip_image(image, 'both')
```

Here, the code applies the flip_image function to the loaded image variable with 
different directions: **'horizontal', 'vertical', and 'both'**. 
The flipped images are stored in **horizontal_flip, vertical_flip, and both_flip** variables, respectively.

```python

cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
cv2.imshow('Horizontal Flip', horizontal_flip)
cv2.imshow('Vertical Flip', vertical_flip)
cv2.imshow('Both Flip', both_flip)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

These lines display the original and flipped images using OpenCV's **`cv2.imshow()`** function. 
The function takes two parameters: 
the **window name** (used as a title for the image window) 
and the **image** to be displayed. The code displays the original image in a window 
titled **'Original Image'**, the horizontally flipped image in a window 
titled **'Horizontal Flip'**, the vertically flipped image in a window 
titled **'Vertical Flip'**, and the image flipped in both directions in a window 
titled **'Both Flip'**. **`cv2.waitKey(0)`** waits for a keyboard event **(0 indicates an indefinite wait)** 
and **`cv2.destroyAllWindows()`** closes all open image windows when a key is pressed.

## Code Execution:

To execute the code, follow these steps:

Install OpenCV by running **`pip install opencv-python`** in your Python environment if you haven't already.
Replace the **'HBD.jpg'** with the actual path to your image file.
Save the code snippet in a Python file with a **.py** extension, e.g., **image_flip.py**.
Run the Python file using a Python interpreter, such as **python image_flip.py**.
Upon execution, the code will display four image windows: **'Original Image'** showing the original image, 
**'Horizontal Flip'** showing the image flipped horizontally, 
**'Vertical Flip'** showing the image flipped vertically, and 
**'Both Flip'** showing the image flipped in both directions. You can close the windows by pressing any key.

Please note that the code assumes that the specified image file exists and is accessible. 
If the image is not found or the path is incorrect, the code will not be able to load the image.
